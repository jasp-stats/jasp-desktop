<h1>How to use the R Filter</h1>

<p>
	Using the R filter gives you the opportunity to write custom filters for your data.
	You can combine this easily with the results from the other filters, that is, those selected in the variable window or made in the easy filter.
	In fact, you can easily observe the code that is generated by those other filters in the top read-only textbox that starts with <span class="code">generatedFilter &lt;-</span>.
</p>

<p>
	To refer to your data simply enter the columnname in the code-window, JASP will make sure that it refers to the correct data. 
	If your columnname contains spaces you must enter these as well.
	You can also transform the type of the column by appending the wanted type. 
	So suppose we have a column named <code>chestnut</code> we can convert it to any type as: <code>chestnut.scale, chestnut.ordinal and chestnut.nominal</code>.
</p>

<p>
	Some examples, which will of course only work if your data contains those columns, should serve to clarify:
	<ul>
			<li>
					<b>Filtering the opposite of the easy-filter and label-selection</b>
					<p class="code">!generatedFilter</p>
			</li>
			<li>
					<b>Filtering on Gender and TestScore</b>
					<p class="code">Gender == "Female" & TestScore > 5</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<b>Filtering on Gender and TestScore while taking into account easy-filter and label-selection</b>
					<p class="code">generatedFilter & Gender == "Female" & TestScore > 5</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<b>Filtering on Age conditioned on Sex</b>
				<p class="code">(mean(Age) > Age) %|% Sex</p>
				<p>
					The operator %|% is a JASP-specific R-operator that makes sure the code to the left of it is run separately for each condition to it's right. 
					In this case it means that the filter passes all rows on which Age is lower than the mean Age for that specific Sex.
					Be sure to add the parentheses around the exact expression that you wish to be conditioned though, the following would not work as expected: <span class="code">mean(Age) &gt; Age %|% Sex</span>.
					This would just condition Age on Sex, while leaving mean(Age) to be calculated for the whole column.
				</p>

			</li>
	</ul>
