Random sampling
==========================

Random sampling is the most straight-forward sampling method. With this method, every sampling unit has the same probability of being selected as every other sampling unit. A random selection of size <i>n</i> of the sampling units is then taken (using the seed option) and the corresponding population entries are included in the sample.
