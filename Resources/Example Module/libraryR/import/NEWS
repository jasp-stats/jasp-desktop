Version 1.0.2
=============

* You can now specify which library to use, and only one library is ever
  used in a single call: there is no ambiguity about where imports come from.
* There is a distinction between using double- and triple colon syntax;
  analogously to using :: and ::: operators.
* If the package is attached (e.g. via library) there is a startup message
  informing the user that the package is not meant to be attached.
* It is only possible to use the functions with the `import::` / `import:::`
  syntax.
