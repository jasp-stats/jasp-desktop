		<p>
			​JASP is a cross platform statistical software program with a state-of-the-art graphical user interface. 
			It offers standard analysis procedures in both	their classical and Bayesian form. 
		</p>
		<p>
			It was designed with the user in mind: APA-formatted tables can be copy-pasted in your word processor, output can be extensively annotated, adjustment of input options dynamically changes the output, and selecting 
			old output revives the associated input choices for inspection and adjustment.
		</p>
		<p>
			JASP is also statistically inclusive, as it offers both frequentist and Bayesian analysis methods. 
			Indeed, the primary motivation for JASP is to make it easier for statistical practitioners to conduct Bayesian analyses.
		</p>

					<description>
						New release 0.14.1

						Because the previous release was actually 0.14 but the number given was 0.14.1 this version is now 0.14.1.1.
						It corresponds to 0.14.1 on win and mac though. Apologies for any confusion.

						Improvements:
						- Several changes to the audit module 
						-- Evaluate audit samples more efficiently #4411
						-- More prior construction methods #700
						-- UVB functionality #1149
						- More computing speed for RoBMA #4408
						- Previously the effect size estimates and confidence intervals in the one-sample t-test were defined in terms of differences with respect to the test point. Both the effect size estimates and confidence intervals are now defined independently of the test point #4407
						- Updates to Data Library (new Datasaurus and World Happiness examples) #4393

						Bug fixes 
						- Fix to multigroup SEM #4394
						- Fix to t-test #4390
						- fixing marginal custom CI in predictive distributions #4397
