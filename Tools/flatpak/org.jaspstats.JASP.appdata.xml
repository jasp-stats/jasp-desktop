		<p>
			​JASP is a cross platform statistical software program with a state-of-the-art graphical user interface. 
			It offers standard analysis procedures in both	their classical and Bayesian form. 
		</p>
		<p>
			It was designed with the user in mind: APA-formatted tables can be copy-pasted in your word processor, output can be extensively annotated, adjustment of input options dynamically changes the output, and selecting 
			old output revives the associated input choices for inspection and adjustment.
		</p>
		<p>
			JASP is also statistically inclusive, as it offers both frequentist and Bayesian analysis methods. 
			Indeed, the primary motivation for JASP is to make it easier for statistical practitioners to conduct Bayesian analyses.

**New Features and Improvements**

- New module:
  - Survival (Beta)
  - Process (Beta)

- Data Editing:
  - Redesign the Variable setting window
  - Possibility to switch computed columns to not computed and vice-versa
  - Add empty values settings per variable
  - Make JASP readable on small screen
  - Copy/Paste with headers work between JASP and other spreadsheet editor.
  - Undo/Redo shortcut available everywhere on data editing mode

- Results:
  - Add video support in annotation (https://github.com/jasp-stats/jasp-desktop/pull/5293)

- Windows Installation
  - Add MSIX Installation in [Windows Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9P08CWG12JNL).

- Audit:
  - implements algorithm auditing (i.e., model fairness, a new section in the module): https://github.com/jasp-stats/jaspAudit/pull/371

- Factor/CFA
  - Option to fix intercepts to zero in mean structure (https://github.com/jasp-stats/jasp-issues/issues/2223)
  - Add structural invariance and mean structure identification options (https://github.com/jasp-stats/jasp-issues/issues/2378, https://github.com/jasp-stats/jaspFactor/pull/193)

- Machine Learning:
  - Add Naive Bayes classification analysis (https://github.com/jasp-stats/jaspMachineLearning/pull/244):
Implements some explainable modelling ('XAI') features from the DALEX package
    - After model performance, implemented an option in all supervised analyses to show feature importance metrics (via https://ema.drwhy.ai/featureImportance.html).
    - After feature importance, implemented an option in all supervised analyses (and the prediction analysis) to explain the predictions of the model as a sum of feature contributions (via https://ema.drwhy.ai/breakDown.html#breakDown).
    - Added multivariate normality check in the LDA analysis (https://github.com/jasp-statsjasp-issues#2272)
    - Adds a bare-bones linear regression analysis as a baseline method in which the user can use a training and test set to compare the results with other techniques.
  - Linear Regression: Add an option to display the regression equation for (regularised) linear regression (https://github.com/jasp-stats/jaspMachineLearning/pull/227)
  - Optimization for support vector machines and decision trees (https://github.com/jasp-stats/jaspMachineLearning/issues/84)

- SEM:
  - Add mean structure option fixing mean intercepts to zero (https://github.com/jasp-stats/jaspSem/pull/186)


**Bug fixes**
- Multiple labelfilters do not combine correctly (https://github.com/jasp-stats/jasp-issues/issues/2376)
- Filter still active after reopen new session (https://github.com/jasp-stats/jasp-issues/issues/2344)
- Export csv file from .jasp file will lose values (https://github.com/jasp-stats/jasp-issues/issues/2396)
- Latex in darkmode (https://github.com/jasp-stats/jasp-desktop/pull/5311)
- Bayesian ANOVA: Fix Single model inference (https://github.com/jasp-stats/INTERNAL-jasp/issues/2426)
- Learn Bayes: fix bracket at logBF10 (https://github.com/jasp-stats/jaspLearnBayes/pull/171)
- Machine Learning:
  - Do not scale the target variable in regression anymore.
  - Fix bugs in Neural Network analyses related to activation function use (had wrong input for linear.output argument).
- Quality Control
  - Graph variation components has not been built (https://github.com/jasp-stats/jasp-issues/issues/2273)
  - Percentage Process Variation Graph hadn't been built (https://github.com/jasp-stats/jasp-issues/issues/2274)
  - Attributes Agreement Analysis analysis crash (https://github.com/jasp-stats/jasp-issues/issues/2286)
  - Added help files (https://github.com/jasp-stats/jaspQualityControl/pull/285)
  - Fixed issue that sometimes broke the RSM analysis (https://github.com/jasp-stats/jaspQualityControl/pull/281). The rsm package calculated some "canonicals" that were not used in the JASP output. Setting the threshold to calcuate these to 0 resolved the issue.
  - Removed option to specify blocks again, breaks too often.
  - Removed options to specify manual terms for RSM analysis, breaks often and is not really useful without possibility of adding squared terms.
- Regression analyses:
  - Bug in German translation (https://github.com/jasp-stats/jaspRegression/issues/268, https://github.com/jasp-stats/jasp-issues/issues/2405)
  - Wrong values of Nagelkerke and Cox and Snell R^2 reported (https://github.com/jasp-stats/jasp-issues/issues/2368)
- Reliability
  - CI for Krippendorff's alpha (https://github.com/jasp-stats/jasp-issues/issues/2318)
- SEM
  - Chi-square change with addtion of second model (https://github.com/jasp-stats/jasp-issues/issues/2302)
