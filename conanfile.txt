# You can search the availability of a certain library here, https://conan.io/center/
# After adding the library, you can add it to the target using
#
# - `CONAN_PKG::library-name` (if you use this, you don't need to add the header files)
# - or ${CONAN_LIBS_LIBRARY-name} (it needs to be upper case)
# 
# The header files can be added to a target using ${CONAN_INCLUDE_DIRS_LIBRARY-NAME}
