**JASP** is a cross-platform software that allows you to conduct statistical analyses in seconds,
and without having to learn programming or risking a programming mistake. It aims to be a 
complete statistical package for both Bayesian and Frequentist statistical methods, 
that is easy to use and familiar to users of SPSS.
