# cmake-format[1] is a tiny tool that automatically format CMake files
# CMake syntax is already strange, and as we are sharing it between
# several people, it is probably good to have an standards.
#
# You can get it using `pip install cmakelang` and run it using
# `cmake-format -i <your-cmake-file>`. It is usually smart enough to 
# use this file, if not, you can run 
# `cmake-format -c .cmake-format.yaml -i <your-cmake-file>`
#
# Both SublimeText[2] and VSCode[3] have plugins for it as well:

# How wide to allow formatted cmake files
line_width: 80

# How many spaces to tab for indent
tab_size: 2

# If an argument group contains more than this many sub-groups (parg or kwarg
# groups), then force it to a vertical layout.
max_subgroups_hwrap: 2

# If a positinal argument group contains more than this many arguments, then
# force it to a vertical layout.
max_pargs_hwrap: 3

# If true, separate flow control names from their parentheses with a space
separate_ctrl_name_with_space: false

# If true, separate function names from parentheses with a space
separate_fn_name_with_space: false

# If a statement is wrapped to more than one line, than dangle the closing
# parenthesis on it's own line
dangle_parens: false

# If the trailing parenthesis must be 'dangled' on it's on line, then align it
# to this reference: `prefix`: the start of the statement,  `prefix-indent`: the
# start of the statement, plus one indentation  level, `child`: align to the
# column of the arguments
dangle_align: "prefix"

min_prefix_chars: 4

# If the statement spelling length (including space and parenthesis is larger
# than the tab width by more than this amoung, then force reject un-nested
# layouts.
max_prefix_chars: 10

# If a candidate layout is wrapped horizontally but it exceeds this many lines,
# then reject the layout.
max_lines_hwrap: 2

# What style line endings to use in the output.
line_ending: "unix"

# Format command names with this case. Options are "lower", "upper",
# "unchanged"
command_case: "lower"

# Format keywords consistently as 'lower' or 'upper' case
keyword_case: "unchanged"

# A list of command names which should always be wrapped
always_wrap: "[]"

# If true, the argument lists which are known to be sortable will be sorted
# lexicographicall
enable_sort: true

# If true, the parsers may infer whether or not an argument list is sortable
# (without annotation).
autosort: false

# If a comment line starts with at least this many consecutive hash characters,
# then don't lstrip() them off. This allows for lazy hash rulers where the first
# hash char is not separated by space
hashruler_min_length: 10

# --------------------------
# Comment Formatting Options
# --------------------------
# What character to use for bulleted lists
bullet_char: "*"

# What character to use as punctuation after numerals in an enumerated list
enum_char: "."

# enable comment markup parsing and reflow
enable_markup: false

# If comment markup is enabled, don 't reflow the first comment block in each
# listfile.Use this to preserve formatting of your copyright / license
# statements.
first_comment_is_literal: false

# If comment markup is enabled, don 't reflow any comment block which matches
# this(regex) pattern.Default is `None`(disabled).
literal_comment_pattern: "None"

# Regular expression to match preformat fences in comments
# default = r '^\s*([`~]{3}[`~]*)(.*)$'
fence_pattern: "^\\s*([`~]{3}[`~]*)(.*)$"

# Regular expression to match rulers in comments
# default = r '^\s*[^\w\s]{3}.*[^\w\s]{3}$'
ruler_pattern: "^\\s*[^\\w\\s]{3}.*[^\\w\\s]{3}$"

# If true, then insert a space between the first hash char and remaining hash
# chars in a hash ruler, and normalize it 's length to fill the column
canonicalize_hashrulers: true

# ---------------------------------
# Miscellaneous Options
# ---------------------------------
# If true, emit the unicode byte - order mark(BOM) at the start of the file
emit_byteorder_mark: false

# Specify the encoding of the input file.Defaults to utf - 8.
input_encoding: "utf-8"

# Specify the encoding of the output file.Defaults to utf - 8. Note that cmake
# only claims to support utf - 8 so be careful when using anything else
